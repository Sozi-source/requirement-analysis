# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting **Requirement Analysis**, a crucial phase in software development. 

Requirement analysis involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified product. The goal is to ensure all stakeholders clearly understand what the system should do before development begins.

## What is Requirement Analysis?‚Äù
Requirement analysis is the initial step in the software development process where the developer gathers, analyses, and defines the requirements of the proposed software product. It ensures all the stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and what it will perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
It helps understand what the stakeholders expect from the system.
It clearly defines the scope of the project, reducing the chances of scope creep.
It enhances accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
It ensures the final product meets the specified requirements, ensuring customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
  1. Requirement Gathering
     It involves collecting data from the stakeholders using:
     - Interviews
     - Questionnaires
     - workshop
     - Observation
     - Document analysis
  3. Requirement Elicitation
     - It involves conducting brainstorming sessions and focus group discussions with the stakeholders to generate ideas and gather requirements.
     - Use of a prototype is also used to enhance system visualization and refine the requirements. 
  5. Requirement Documentation
     - It involves creating a detailed description of the system's functional and non-functional requirements.
     - User stories are used to describe functionalities from the user's perspective.
     - Use cases are used to show the interaction between the user and the system
  7. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
     -It involves:
       * Requirements prioritization- based on the importance and impact on the project.
       * Feasibility analysis- technical, financial, and time.
       * Modelling- data models, e.g., data flow diagram to visualise and analyse the requirements.
  9. Requirement Validation.
      -It involves:
       * Reviewing and approval of the requirements.
       * Defining acceptance criteria for each requirement.
       * Establish a traceability matrix to ensure all requirements are addressed during development.
    
      ## Types of Requirements

        ## Functional Requirements
               * It defines what the system should do. For example, user authentication, property search, booking system, and user registration.

        ## Non-functional Requirements
               * It describes how the system should work, such as performance, security, scalability, usability, and reliability.
