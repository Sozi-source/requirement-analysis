# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting **Requirement Analysis**, a crucial phase in software development. 

Requirement analysis involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified product. The goal is to ensure all stakeholders clearly understand what the system should do before development begins.

This repository will include notes, templates, examples, and tools used for effective requirement analysis.
